What is machine learning, and you ask me?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>From a time to this part, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data\">Big Data<\/a>,\nthe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\">Machine Learning<\/a>, the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">Artificial Intelligence<\/a>,\nthe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot\">Bots<\/a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science\">Data Science<\/a>&#8230;&#8203;\nHave jumped to the covers, that the technicians visit assiduously. All of them\noverlap in certain domains, and have certain relationships, that a rookie of the\ncomputing, may not get clear, and therefore not know where it starts\none and finish another.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Throughout this trip, which we will do next to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pacotheai\">@pacotheai<\/a>,\nwe will try to make clear the limits of each one of these worlds,\nto be able to dive in them without the currents of one to another they take away to us.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with clarifying where is ML versus AI? The objective of the AI is to\nteach computers, to do what humans do today, better, and learning is undoubtedly\nthe most important of those things. The machine learning, can be considered a\nsubfield of artificial intelligence, but as we have said, has grown so much, that\ntoday has more pull than his father. Under the different names of the ML we have:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition\">recognition of patterns<\/a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining\">data mining<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics\">predictive analysis<\/a> &#8230;&#8203;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>And within the ML, how many ways to do things there, and since when there is each?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence\">symbolists<\/a>\nwork with the reverse deduction (from the particular to the general). Very usual\nbetween '50 and '80, in the creation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system\">expert systems<\/a>\nor those known today, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_rule\">bussines rules<\/a>.\nThese expert systems have an inference engine, \"if-else\" set, and\na knowledge database. With both pieces, new situations could be predicted.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism\">Connectivism<\/a>, unlike\nthe symbolists, think that life does not work by logic. The basic theory\nis the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience\">neuroscience<\/a>, and its master algorithm,\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation\">Backpropagation<\/a>. The connectivists,\nhave their heyday around the year 2000, and this is where the neural networks,\nbegin to gain strength.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation\">Evolutionary<\/a> are based\nin the principles of evolutionary biology, Darwin. There can only be one, which\nwould say Connor Macleod. The alternatives compete with each other, they mix and only the\nmore suitable are not discarded, which is progressively better solutions.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference\">Bayesian<\/a> have the\nas an ally, to determine the likelihood that something we see the probability\nthat it has already happened before, with a \"correction factor\".<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Last would be the analogists. Let&#8217;s think about the recommendation algorithms.\nIf A and B have similar tastes, what B knows and A does not, A. will like it.\nWould like to refer here to a book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.es/dp/8490322503\">Thinking fast, Thinking Slow<\/a>\nthat can help us understand how we think.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It is clear that 70 years, to this part, things have changed a lot in this worlds\nof technology. The blessed silicic, the microprocessors, all this has allowed to\njump into the void &#8230;&#8203; But what about all these algorithms? Programmers only\nunderstand code. How is this coded?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Little by little we will learn together as each of these tribes works, and try\nto frame the code that we use within one or several of those paths, because in\nsearch of the perfect algorithm for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pacotheai\">@pacotheai<\/a>,\nmany of the libraries we use mix the different approaches, until now known.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For now, just a small tips, a series of steps: data acquisition,\nnormalization, design the \"neural network\": input, hidden, output layers,\nactivation functions and optimization of the result.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Are you ready to embark on the path to barbecue?
